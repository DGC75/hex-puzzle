    Recursive function to solve a problem.

    The idea is that, once a piece is positioned, the problem becomes an 
    easier problem, with one piece left and a different starting grid.

    This function, given a grid state (with possibly some piece already 
    positioned) and a piece (as an index in a list of pieces), tries to find a
    valid position for the piece. Once this is found, it recusively call itself.

    In case the problem is solved, the grid will contain the configuration of 
    pieces (i.e. each cell will contain the index of the piece occupying it), 
    while `pieces` will contain the concrete pieces that solve the problem.
